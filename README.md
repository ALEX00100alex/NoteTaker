# NoteTaker
An application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file.

# Background 

This is my first attempt at building a Note Taker app using express and node.js

## Functionality

GIVEN a note-taking application <br />
WHEN user opens the Note Taker <br />
THEN they are presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page <br />
WHEN user clicks on the link to the notes page <br />
THEN they are presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new  note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column<br />
WHEN user enters a new note title and the note’s text<br />
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page<br />
WHEN user clicks on the Save icon<br />
THEN the new note they have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes<br />
WHEN user clicks on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column<br />
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column<br />
WHEN user clicks on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page<br />
THEN they are presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column<br />
